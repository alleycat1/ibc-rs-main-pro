//! This library implements the InterBlockchain Communication (IBC) protocol in Rust. IBC is
//! a distributed protocol that enables communication between distinct sovereign blockchains.
//!
//! The layout of this crate mirrors the organization of the [IBC
//! Standard][ibc-standard]:
//!
//! + [Core](core) implements the transport, authentication, and ordering layers of the IBC protocol.
//!
//! + [Clients](clients) consists of implementations of client verification algorithms (following the base
//! client interface that is defined in `Core`) for specific consensus algorithms. A chain uses these
//! verification algorithms to verify the state of remote chains.
//!
//! + [Applications](applications) consists of implementations of some IBC applications. This is the part of
//! the protocol that abstracts away the core protocol and focuses solely on business logic.
//!
//! When processing a given message `M`, if any method in this library returns an error, the runtime
//! is expected to rollback all state modifications made to the context
//! (e.g. [`ExecutionContext`](core::ExecutionContext)) while processing `M`. If a transaction on your
//! blockchain contains multiple messages, then typically the state modifications from all messages
//! is expected to be rolled back as well.
//!
//! # Note
//!
//! Currently, the `serde` feature (required by the token transfer app) does not work in `no_std` environments.
//! See context [here](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-proto-rs/pull/92). If this is a blocker for you, please
//! open a Github issue.
