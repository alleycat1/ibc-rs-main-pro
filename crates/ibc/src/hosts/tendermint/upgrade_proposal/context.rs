//! Helper Context for handling upgrade client proposals.
//!
//! Currently. this interface has been defined to support Tendermint-based
//! chains. You can check out a sample implementation in the
//! [Basecoin-rs](https://github.com/informalsystems/basecoin-rs) repository.
//! If it proves to be generic enough, we may move it to the ICS02 section.
